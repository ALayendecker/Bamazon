<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This app will let a user query multiple sets of data from different APIs.

- This app could be used as one stop shop for specific searches regarding the most recent upcoming concert for an artist. See - [Band In Town](#concert-this)

- A spotify search based off song name. See - [Spotify](#spotify-this-song)

* A movie search based off movie title. See - [OMDB](#movie-this)

### Built With

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Node Package - DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [Node Package - mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
- [othneildrew - Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)

<!-- Organization -->

## Organization

Requires are located at the top of the liri.js file along with an instanciated spotify and user input global variable.

All functions are called through a switch case wrapped into a function for logging. Each of the four commands used in this app have their own functions.

`concert-this`

`spotify-this-song`

`movie-this`

`do-what-it-says`

The functions themselves are created in the bottom half of the liri.js file.

- Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for `movie-this`, `spotify-this-song` and `concert-this`.
